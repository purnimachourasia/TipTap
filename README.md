#  TipTap Multi-Page A4 Document Editor

This project implements a multi-page A4-style document editor using [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) with features like:

- Custom "Page" view with A4 styling
- Manual page breaks using a toolbar button
- Footer page numbers
- Per-page rendering with pagination buttons
- Character and word count tracking
- Zoom, margins, and watermark configuration support (in progress)

---

##  Features

- Page-styled layout mimicking A4 (800×1122 px)
- Dynamic toolbar tab ("Text", "Page")
- Manual **Page Break** insertion
- Page footer showing `Page X`
- Pagination controls to navigate between pages

---

##  Constraints & Trade-offs

| Area | Constraint | Trade-off |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Page rendering | All TipTap content is shared across all pages | Same content renders on all pages until proper splitting is added |
| Page break handling | Manual "Page Break" button increases `totalPages` | Doesn’t insert a true page break node into the TipTap doc |
| Pagination | Pages are scrollable and selectable via buttons | No virtual scrolling — might be heavy for long docs |
| Editor reuse | A single TipTap instance is used | Editing updates all pages at once |
| Print/PDF | Not fully implemented yet | Needs custom rendering or `html2pdf`, `puppeteer`, or server-side export tools |

##  How to Productionize

### Logical Page Splitting
- **Current**: Pages are duplicated with shared content.
- **Fix**: Implement a `PageBreak` node extension and split `editor.state.doc` on these to render real paginated views.

###  Dynamic Page Rendering
- Build per-page editable zones or create a new Editor instance per page.
- Alternatively, create a read-only preview that splits content correctly based on page breaks.

###  PDF Export
- Use libraries like:
  - `html2pdf.js` (for client-side export)
  - `puppeteer` (server-side headless Chrome PDF)
  - `jsPDF` (if building structured PDF manually)

### Features to Add
- Header/footer support
- Page thumbnails
- Sidebar for navigation
- Undo/redo
- Collaboration (via Yjs, Socket.IO, etc.)

## Testing & Reliability

- Add integration tests for:
  - Inserting/removing page breaks
  - Page counting
  - Content overflow behavior
- Handle edge cases like long tables/images across pages

---

## Deployment Suggestions

- Host using Vercel, Netlify, or any static host (if frontend only)
- Use Supabase / Firebase for saving documents
- Use Node.js + Puppeteer for exporting rich PDF
